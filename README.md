# Expo Camera Barcode Parsing Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API's barcode scanning functionality. The issue lies in the inconsistent format of the barcode data returned by the API, leading to unexpected application behavior or crashes.

## Bug Description

The `onBarCodeScanned` callback provides barcode data that doesn't always match the expected structure. This inconsistency results in errors during data processing and can cause application instability.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the application: `expo start`
4. Scan a barcode. Observe the inconsistent data output in the console.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing robust error handling and data validation to accommodate the varying formats of the barcode data. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code that addresses this issue.
